#Movie Trailer Website  
This is a Python application that creates a website with a list of the movie trailers.

#Usage
Open the file named Media.py and run with Python

#Contribution
##Bugs and potential improvements
The current design only allows creating the trailer through the code. In the future, it might be great to create a website that allows user to create the trailer directly through the web page.
##Developing
All modifications are welcome.
